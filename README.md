# Friend in Need

Our live [web app](https://celebilaw.github.io/lahacks22)!

Our [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ofPCc7tHNW43lKK56T5ANL/Friend-in-Me?node-id=56%3A938)!

## Inspiration
Everyone could use an extra friend to lend them something in times of need.

## What it does
_Friend in Need_ connects students to get them the things they need. For example, if you are in a library and forgot your computer charger, you can just request one through Friend in Need, and a fellow student can help you out!

## How we built it
We built Friend in Need with React, Git, Firebase Cloud Firestore, Material UI, Tailwind, CSS, and Figma. 

## What's next for _Friend in Need_
Student rideshare connections to allow students to save money and carpool with their peers to go on adventures!
