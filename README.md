# LA Hacks 2022

## Inspiration
Everyone could use an extra friend to lend them something in times of need.

## What it does
Friend in Need connects students to get them the things they need. For example, if you are in a library and forgot your computer charger, you can just request one through Friend in Need, and a fellow student can help you out!

## How we built it
We built Friend in Need with React, Git, Firebase Cloud Firestore, Material UI, Tailwind, CSS, and Figma. 

## Challenges we ran into
Diverging git branching, overwriting Material UI, database management, and more!

The divergent branches were definitely our most difficult challenge, and we had no idea how to resolve it. We attempted to git pull (with fast forward on). Eventually, we solved it by recloning the repository. (Definitely not an ideal solution!) From this, we learned to always merge main into our branch, then merge our branch into main. And of course, to always `git fetch` and `git pull` main.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing the entire process of ideation, design, development, prototyping, and testing to create our MVP.  We're especially proud of our clean design, with the help of Figma and Material UI.

## What we learned
We learned how to work together as a team, the practice of git committing early and often, and how to pivot and overcome problems. 

## What's next for Friend in Need
Student rideshare connections to allow students to save money and carpool with their peers to go on adventures!
